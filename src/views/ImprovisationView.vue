        Jean-Luc Guionnet and Seijiro Murayama came to the University of
        Huddersfield to lead an improvisation workshop. The workshop allowed us
        to explore new methods of sound-making, and taught us about sharing
        space with different performers. From this, we took part in a group
        performance at the CeReNeM Journal Showcase.

      <h3>Freya</h3>
      <p>
        I played a flamenco guitar for my solo improvisation [...] for the most
        part, I avoided traditional flamenco techniques, instead using a cello
        bow for scraping and creaking sounds
      </p>
      <p>
        [My] approach was inspired by the workshop by Jean-Luc Guionnet and
        Seijiro Murayama, who discussed techniques for detaching from an
        instrument’s conventional idioms and breaking free from traditional
        constraints. This does not preclude common idioms but encourages
        reconceptualisation of how an instrument is approached.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite my inexperience with contemporary on-stage improvisation
        compared to my peers, I was pleased with the performance’s haunting
        soundscape.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>The solo is always playing inside you</p>
      <br />
      <p>Listen to other people.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Coming into silence is very imposing</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Improvising for me has been about creating a dense atmosphere, the
        specifics of the sound aren't always the most important element…
      </p>
      <h3>Sophie</h3>
      <p>An interesting experience!</p>
      <p>
        Seijiro Murayama had us taking part in movement exercises that I
        personally found a bit cringe worthy and something I would normally run
        miles away from taking part in due to deep rooted, long term
        embarrassment associated with the body and early childhood experiences.
        Not for me, basically! Physically navigating around the other people in
        the group and the room itself can be seen as similar to how sound and
        music moves around an auditory space during an improvisation. You’ve got
        to be careful not to trip someone else up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, the most useful feedback I received from Jean-Luc was a
        comment about how I tend to create a groove / loop when improvising on
        the trombone which becomes a sort of sonic-trap that is hard to escape
        from, and I agree with this.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose the answer is, knowing that I have this tendency, to practice
        improvisation tricks a bit more and either look for obvious exit signs
        or just go wild and smash through the walls
      </p>
      <h3>Tom</h3>
      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges I face as an improviser and composer is
        working out what my music is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to the workshop with Seijiro and Jean-Luc, I would have described
        improvising as a difficult balance between making my music and allowing
        everyone else’s music space to breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main thing I learnt from this experience was that I can make my own
        music and at the same time provide space for others to make their music.
      </p>
      <p>
        My music or ‘necessity’ as Seijro put it feels somewhat irrelevant and
        what now feels significant is when my music occurs
      </p>
      <p>
        I am still full of questions, but these are focused around a positive
        angle: what can my music become with the company of others? This is
        something which fills me with optimism about the future of my music.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no doubt that a synthesiser can make a louder sound than an
        acoustic cello, but if the aim of the improvisation is not a rise to a
        climax, then the volume levels of these instruments may not be an issue.
        Working together can unlock a new music which doesn’t compromise the
        musical necessity of either instrument.

      <p>PART 1: Not a musician</p>
      <p>
        It's strange to write about this now, because it's a sentiment I've left
        behind, and was probably on the cusp of leaving behind at the time of
        starting the improv workshop, but funnily enough I did begin my MA in
        Music thinking of myself as 'not a musician'.
      </p>
      <p>Reasons for this classification:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I dropped Music in Year 9</li>
        <li>I've never had instrument lessons of any sort</li>
        <li>I can't read or write traditional notation</li>
        <li>I can't identify by ear: notes, chords, keys, time signatures</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think my path has actually been a relatively common one. I came from
        visual art, into 'sound art', into noise-based music, and now that's
        where my practice sits: noise, computer music, electronics, glitch etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        By this time I had started performing some of my 'sound art', and was
        coming round to the idea that I might be a musician, but definitely not
        an improviser. All my performances were pre-planned and rehearsed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I mention this is I had gone into the workshop thinking, at
        least for the first day, I would just listen and not take part. I wasn't
        an improviser, so who knows what would be expected of me?
      </p>
      <p>That I take part, for one.</p>
      <p>PART 2: A series of ERRORS</p>
      <p>
        So I took out my beloved decrepit old laptop, running a fresh install of
        Ubuntu that I had yet to re-setup with SuperCollider & TidalCycles, and
        tried to find something I could play.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had a little digital instrument / browser tool / performance UI (I'm
        still not sure what I call them) that I had recently built to perform
        with called 'Clock'.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a grid of 365 buttons. A number which is related to the ✨ concept
        ✨ of the piece for which it was built, but arbitrary for this new
        purpose. Each button can be switched on to output white noise through a
        band pass filter tuned to a frequency taken from a dataset containing
        some numbers also only 🌼 meaningful 🌼 in another context.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's some automation on the original version of Clock, blocks of
        buttons are briefly switched on at set intervals throughout the
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are keyboard shortcuts to play: all the low, medium, or high
        frequencies, a random frequency, a reverse of the currently selected
        buttons, all the buttons, and to switch off all the currently playing
        buttons.
      </p>
      <p>I decided I could use this as long as I removed the automation.</p>
      <p>
        The first improv began, everyone in a big circle doing solo-duo, I took
        a spot in the circle where I could plug in my laptop and started to edit
        the code. I think the first time I was meant to play I said I wasn't
        ready, but the second I produced a very quiet little bunch of sounds
        directly out of my laptop speakers.
      </p>
      <p>Woah - improvisation!</p>
      <p>
        I found time to improve my instrument's suitability for improv
        throughout the day: standardising the frequency range to evenly spaced
        values, and upping the max gain to I could get more volume out of my
        laptop speakers.
      </p>
      <p>I think the latter is what broke the speaker.</p>
      <p>
        Half way through an exercise it started doing this, and honestly it was
        super fun, I couldn't modulate the sound via Clock anymore so I just had
        to physically move the computer around to have the sound bounce and
        resonate in different ways.
      </p>
      <p>Improvisation 😎</p>
      <p>
        All good I thought, I have a shiny new MacBook and nice monitor at home,
        I can bring this tomorrow, it will be my rig. I'll buy one of those hard
        shell suitcases to transport it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I locked my new suitcase with a code - and must have set it up wrong,
        because I couldn't get back in. Luckily, Jo Christman always carries a
        screwdriver, but I had to wait until lunch to break in and free my tech.
      </p>
      <p>PART 3: Metronome+</p>
      <p>
        Seijiro told me his favourite instrument to improvise with is a
        metronome. I have a metronome app on my phone.
      </p>
      <p>Improvisation 💃</p>
      <p>
        What's great about using the metronome is you get to practice
        constraint. I begin by thinking 'ok I can modulate the bpm and the
        'voice', that's probably enough', but Seijiro encouraged me to stick
        with one voice, and one (fairly slow) BPM.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember one solitary 'click' in the middle of some silence being one
        of my favourite gestures I made during the workshop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Structuring this writing how I have isn't to imply that I undertook some
        kind of linear hero's journey from non-improviser to improviser over the
        course of three days. I actually found the workshop immediately
        engaging, accessible, and understandable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder if my lack of musician-y background helped me get into the idea
        of non-idiomatic improv easier? I wonder if playing electronics over a
        traditional instrument did?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a number of techniques and ideas I took away, and still think
        about when improvising now.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Having a constant internal 'tiktikitikitik' that you start/stop,
          surface/bury.
        </li>
        <li>
          Considering the end of a sound just as much of an event as the start
          of one.
        </li>
        <li>
          The idea of 'soupiness', the instinct to politely make space for every
          other sound in the room, waiting your turn to duck in and out. This is
          one approach, it isn't bad, but how do you prevent it from being the
          default?
        </li>
      </ul>
